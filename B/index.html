<p>In this module we will use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<pre>      A  certain HTML element  allows
              text to be displayed as it is entered in the editor.
                    This is called
                            'preformatted'.</pre>


<p>Example of a CSS rule:</p>
<pre><code>       body {
              color: #ff0000;
              font-family: Arial, Verdana; }</pre></code>

<p>To boot an Ubuntu operating system, you need to type the command <kbd>sudo reboot 0<kbd/> in the<br>
   terminal and press the <kbd Enter key</kbd>. After that, the operating system responds with the<br>
   message The system is going down and the PC shuts down.</p>

<p><strong>Very important</strong> words or text passages are highlighted.</p>

<p>In mathematics, some text is <sup>superscripted</sup> or <sub>subscripted,</sub> just like &pi;<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The text in the footer is often printed <small>small</small>.</p>

<p> Words or text passages that are <em>emphasized</em> when speaking can also be emphasized in HTML.</p>

<p>A text can be <mark>highlighted</mark>, like with a text marker.</p>


 <p>Of course you can combine all these HTML elements. Whether this <em>always makes <strong>sense,</strong></em><br>
 however, is questionable. In any case, make sure that the elements are <i>always nested <br>
 correctly</i> and always follow the basic rule: the <strong>first opened</strong> element is <strong>closed last</strong>.</p>
